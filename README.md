# Basic C Backdoor
A very basic C backdoor i created. This is only for learning and experimenting with, not for actual production use.
Its not undetectable, but its a good fundament to start with and the code is easy to understand, if you want to know how backdoors work.

The CnC-Server will get executed on any Unix host server, the backdoor itself only works on Windows-based machines.
